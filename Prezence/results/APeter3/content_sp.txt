only once again and this time my journey
exhausted every day.
us against us we could have been given 20 people in a daze on the podium
transport across the channel my test driven away the block paving
prezence does not understand your speech
shut that novel matters
Patty of malice danger of crashing which are enemies
and every 20 years
it should not be considered and Bute before searching by the same time
never forget dassault assurances of seapower
lost confidence that is all beauty is nothing
prezence does not understand your speech
is necessary for us to see each other
result of His Majesty's government every man of them
British Empire and the French Republic linked together in decor
Stephanie de Sykes eating each other
extract of Europe and many bowlers famous dates have fallen on me for
we shall not flag or fail we shall
we shall fight on the seas and oceans and continents
the Cock Wishaw fight on the beaches we shall fight them then
in the food industry
not for a moment delete this item or large polyp in the sun
the British fleet carry on the struggle
power and might set forth to the rescue and liberation
prezence does not understand your speech
